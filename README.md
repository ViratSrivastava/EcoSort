## Project Overview

EcoSort leverages the power of machine learning and image processing to automate the waste segregation process, increasing efficiency by 85%. The system is deployed on a Raspberry Pi, enabling real-time processing and decision-making.

## Features

- **Intelligent Waste Segregation:** Utilizes ML algorithms to classify waste.
- **Image Processing:** Processes images to identify and categorize waste items.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Deployed on a Raspberry Pi for immediate action and response.
- **Increased Efficiency:** Improves waste segregation accuracy by 85%, reducing the need for manual sorting.

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning:** Developed using Python and popular ML libraries such as TensorFlow and Scikit-learn.
- **Image Processing:** Implemented with OpenCV.
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi for real-time processing and deployment.
- **Other Tools:** NumPy, Pandas for data handling, and Jupyter Notebooks for experimentation and prototyping.


## Usage

To use EcoSort, follow these steps:

1. Connect your camera and sensors to the Raspberry Pi.
2. Run the main script to start the waste segregation process:
    ```bash
    python Epics_final.py
    ```

3. The system will process the waste items in real-time and segregate them accordingly.
